<h1> hihi world </h1>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal website

- 🌱 I’m currently learning visual SLAM

- 🤔 I’m looking for a job in software engineering

Currently pursuing a Master of Science at the University of Michigan – Ann Arbor, I bring a robust background in cutting-edge frameworks for autonomous driving and a strong foundation in software product management.

🛠️ During my tenure at ISUZU Technical Center in Plymouth, Michigan, I conducted in-depth research on autonomous driving frameworks, collaborated on algorithm design within the Robotic Operating System (ROS), and integrated perception components with efficiency. My contribution involved incorporating YOLOv8 models into the ROS2 Foxy framework.

🌐 As a Software Product Manager Intern at AICS @ ASUSTek Computer Inc. in Taipei, Taiwan, I led a team in developing a custom Selenium IDE framework for medical software products. I orchestrated daily scrums, navigated challenges, and formalized natural language processing features for physician-side medical platforms.

💼 Actively seeking full-time opportunities in the tech industry, with a focus on the semiconductor sector and a keen interest in both hardware and software fields. I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.

💻 Additionally, my project experience includes designing an Out-of-Order Processor aligned with Intel R10k chip design principles and creating a Language Detection Model with a remarkable accuracy rate of 98.67%. I've also developed a social media webpage, Insta485, and implemented a CNN Dog Breed Identifier achieving a 71% accuracy rate.

🔧 Proficient in languages such as C++, Python, and JavaScript, I bring a diverse skill set encompassing CMake, MATLAB, Verilog, and more. Fluent in both Chinese and English, I am enthusiastic about leveraging technology to drive innovation and solve complex challenges.

Let's connect and explore opportunities at the intersection of technology and creativity! 🌐✨
